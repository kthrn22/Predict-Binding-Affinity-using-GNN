# Predict-Binding-Affinity-using-GNN

Binding affinity is the strength of the binding interaction between a biomolecule (protein or RNA) and its ligand partner (drug). This project aims to predict the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes, and the model is implemented based on the method in [Predicting drug-target interaction using 3D structure-embedded graph representations from graph neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08144)
